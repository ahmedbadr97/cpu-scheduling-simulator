## Usage
- add all processes through add process area in the home view by adding its arrival time and burst time
- clear button used to clear all inserted processes
- after inserting all processes to run any algorithm
    1. select the algorithm (note : for a round-robin you need to insert the quantum time)
    2. click run button or press enter after entering burst time
